<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a should for usage when you're far from home, but you should not need to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it easy to arm and deactivate the system.

When you add other Ring products to Call Alarm it ends up being a more robust security system that can deliver live video streaming, two-way interaction, and wise lighting.
