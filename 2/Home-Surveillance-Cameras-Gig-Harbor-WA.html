<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
