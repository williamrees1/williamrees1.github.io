If you're on a budget, you can just about get by with the live motion informs and livestreaming (no subscription required). The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of technology.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days.
