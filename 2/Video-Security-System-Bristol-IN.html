<p>Home security need to never be restricted by where you can put or power your cameras, inside your home or outdoors. From what we've seen, Deep Guard is a clear winner when it comes to proactive home security and stopping crime prior to it occurs.

<p>At night, though it does not have the full IR LED array of some competitors, the Arlo catches enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're placing it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the great motion detection. Not just is the Arlo quick to pick out moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out precisely what it's taking a look at. Just a couple years ago, the home security market was controlled by a couple of huge names providing costly, rigid strategies with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-term agreements. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensing units connected to a keypad control board and run through a landline. Nowadays, this has all changed.</p>

<p>I've covered customer electronics for more than 15 years and have tested ratings of smart-home gadgets, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers.

<p>For an outdoor camera that does more than record video and send out notifies, make sure it deals with other wise devices. Numerous recent outdoor Wi-Fi cameras use assistance for IFTTT (If This Then That), an internet service that uses small programs (applets) that you produce to have the camera connect with other IFTTT-enabled devices. For example, you can have a wise plug turn on a lamp inside your home or activate an external siren when the camera discovers motion.</p>
