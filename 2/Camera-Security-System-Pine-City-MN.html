<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a remarkable value. It receives an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for additional cloud storage. But the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is spotted. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>Aside from good Wi-Fi, you may also require a nearby outlet. Most cameras require an AC connection, which indicates you won't be able to put them simply anywhere.

If you include monitoring, charges will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly.
