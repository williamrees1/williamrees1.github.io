<p>You'll need to buy a Nest Aware membership in order to save video footage.

Nest Aware subscriptions are priced per camera, and if you wish to pull out of paying for storage completely, Nest only offers you up to 3 hours worth of recordings.

So pick what will be the better deal for you. If you understand you'll sit tight for at least 3 years, opt for the contract and reap those cost savings. But if you might update to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
