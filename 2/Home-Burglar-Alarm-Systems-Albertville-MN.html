<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 organisations, universities, and government centers, and residential consumers. After researching 4 different security systems, we decided on SSA. They provided us the best description of their services and provided us more for the cash. After having a bad experience with the local installer for ADT and canceling them, we experienced what a truly expert installation ought to be. We feel extremely safe understanding our home is safeguarded by SSA.

The infrared energy discharged by an item is called its heat signature. In general, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of discovering small distinctions in temperature level.
