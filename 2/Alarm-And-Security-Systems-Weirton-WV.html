We actually like the Eufy video doorbell, so I imagine we'll evaluate the security cameras soon. SimpliSafe is not excellent at wise home support. It works with Amazon Alexa, and it offers its own smart door lock, but you can't go setting up many third-party gadgets with your SimpliSafe system. It doesn't work with Z-Wave or IFTTT, and we don't expect it to include extra functionality anytime quickly.</p>

<p>Nest Secure provides loads of smart gadgetry-- a lot so that you may get overwhelmed by all of the choices. However hey, Nest is owned by Google, so we 'd expect absolutely nothing less!

If you're starting from scratch, we 'd most likely advise a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint.</p>
<p>We also like that Ring still has good wise home assistance. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with wise home devices like locks and lights. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your smart outlets with your overall security system. With the advances in innovation, monitoring a home security system is fairly easy. Since the security systems alert property owners to suspicious activity through a smartphone, monitoring a home is as simple as checking a text.
