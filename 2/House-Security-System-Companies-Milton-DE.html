<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
