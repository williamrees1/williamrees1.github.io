<p>The NVR removes these issues, due to the fact that it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR.

In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional electrical wiring.
