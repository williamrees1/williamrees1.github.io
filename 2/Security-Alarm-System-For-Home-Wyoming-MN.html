<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, scams, and vandalism. Idea: Often keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We should again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating costly incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it instantly shut off the heater. You can immediately make the clever lights turn on to terrify away possible burglars if the motion sensors are triggered.</p>
