The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
