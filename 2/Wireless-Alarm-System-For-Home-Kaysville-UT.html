<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a great security camera and an extraordinary value. It gets an Excellent ranking for video quality and is simpler to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
