The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the fact, which means that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and use up a lot of tape-recording storage area. So much, in reality, that they require about four times the disk drive area of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to invest more cash.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
