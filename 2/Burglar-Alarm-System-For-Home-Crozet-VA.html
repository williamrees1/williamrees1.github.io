<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
