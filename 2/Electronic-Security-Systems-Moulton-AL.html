<p>Ring may not be the most innovative system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), however it sure has gained quite the excitement for many years.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly groundbreaking, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower price if you choose a three-year agreement, however considering that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So pick what will be the better deal for you. Go with the contract and reap those cost savings if you understand you'll stay put for at least 3 years. However if you may upgrade to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best option.</p>

<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
