<p>There are two main types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet procedure (IP) cameras and the standard analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern iteration of analog cameras, and while the individual cameras tend to be a little more pricey, they offer a number of features that analog cameras do not.
