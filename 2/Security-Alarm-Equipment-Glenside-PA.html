<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search innovation that is quickly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so important?  For beginners, Deep Knowing enables someone to discover what they are looking for without having to search through hours of useless video footage.  Imagine a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the elements you are looking for in the recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we just type cops" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a patrol car appears.
