Obviously, the obvious disadvantage to a wired security system is that the preliminary install can be expensive. If the system was not installed during the homebuilding procedure, setting one up may need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and gaining access to difficult areas that are sealed in basements or attics. Wired security systems are also susceptible to power outages. Most will have a backup battery system that switches on in case of an outage, but long term failures will lead to the system losing power.
