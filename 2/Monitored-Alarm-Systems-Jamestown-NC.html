<p>GO2 offers full-service Video Surveillance Installation of hd (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Obviously, the obvious disadvantage to a wired security system is that the preliminary install can be expensive. If the system was not installed during the homebuilding procedure, setting one up may need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and gaining access to difficult areas that are sealed in basements or attics. Wired security systems are also susceptible to power outages. Most will have a backup battery system that switches on in case of an outage, but long term failures will lead to the system losing power. When picking a wired system, it's also crucial to think about how long you plan to remain at the very same home. Since these security systems are incorporated into the home's circuitry, they are not portable and can't move with you.</p>

Motion Detection: If you're worried about video storage, check to see if the camera offers motion detection.
