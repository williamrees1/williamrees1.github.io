Maximus Smart Security Light: If you desire a subtle security camera, the Maximus Smart Security Light fits the bill.

A few minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it simply wouldn't link. An assistance window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint representative helped her troubleshoot the connection.

Certainly not ideal-- however the representative asked forgiveness and shipped her replacement control board overnight.</p>
