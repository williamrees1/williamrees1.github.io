<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
