<p>Many surveillance cameras are repaired cameras-- they deal with simply one instructions. PTZ cameras are remotely controlled, and enable the operator to pan (relocation left or right), tilt up and or down, or zoom more detailed or further away in order to follow individuals as they move.

<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And despite having an appealing cost and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients understand that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
