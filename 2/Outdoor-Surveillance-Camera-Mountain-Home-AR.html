<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the producer's stats given that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest offender for short battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit minimal to recommend as a top pick.</p>
