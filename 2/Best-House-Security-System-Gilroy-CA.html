<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
