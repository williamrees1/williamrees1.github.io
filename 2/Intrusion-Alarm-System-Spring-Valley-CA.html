<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
