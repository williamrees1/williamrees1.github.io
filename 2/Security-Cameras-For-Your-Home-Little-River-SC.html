<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
