<h3>Wireless Surveillance Camera Cleves OH 45002</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats because this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest offender for short battery life by far.
