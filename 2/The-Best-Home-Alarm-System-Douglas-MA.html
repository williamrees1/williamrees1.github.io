Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, consisting of creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. However the Secure is pricey, extra sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you don't dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>
