<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
