<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the entire neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you plan to store and the length of time you plan to keep taped video. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to consume storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video as soon as you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>
