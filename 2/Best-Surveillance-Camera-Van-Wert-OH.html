<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were often missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home devices like automated door locks, you can remain in bed and examine that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for potential package burglars or speak with visitors who drop in.</p>

It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send out voice cautions through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you focus on the action. Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for almost 6 months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of up to one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have noticed some enhancements since the camera's launch, and will continue to update this evaluation and check, as needed.</p>
