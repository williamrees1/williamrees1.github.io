<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the producer's stats considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest offender for short battery life without a doubt.

These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is actually fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
