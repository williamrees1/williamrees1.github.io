<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. While burglar alarm innovation has established substantially since the 19th century, it is still based on the basic principles innovated by Augustus Pope and Alexander Bell. All major alarm companies, including Mijac Alarm, utilize distance sensors in the doors and windows as the first line of defense against potential burglars, and alarm systems transfer info to a main monitoring station that can dispatch law enforcement rapidly and effectively.</p>
<p>We realize there are a great deal of choices offered, which is why we offer free phone consultations.

IP cameras can likewise be linked to what is referred to as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, need a switch to run the signal from the camera in addition to a separate power source, suggesting a more intricate setup and more wires. PoE switches are also generally regarded as a more secure way to send data.</p>
<p>IP cameras are much higher resolution, allowing audio and video surveillance to be sent out over a network, with IP addresses assigned to each camera.

In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
