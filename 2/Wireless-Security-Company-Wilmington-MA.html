<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the distinction between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with information after the reality, which indicates that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are large and take up a lot of tape-recording storage area. So much, in truth, that they need about 4 times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape-record the same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more cash if extended video storage is very important.</p>
<p>Even though 1080p is normally the standard resolution for cameras we have actually evaluated, there are advantages to designs with higher-resolution sensing units. Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however practically all have digital zoom, which crop and expand whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
