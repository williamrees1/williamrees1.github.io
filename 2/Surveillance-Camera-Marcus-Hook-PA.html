<p>The majority of contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems incorporate DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to gain some of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog video to digital, which helps to extend storage capability, makes it a lot easier to search archived video footage, and also permits users to stream video over a network for remote watching from several locations.
