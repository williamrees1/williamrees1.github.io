Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you walk by.
