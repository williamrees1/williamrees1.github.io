<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, scams, and vandalism. Idea: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again react to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of pricey false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically shut off the heating systems. If the motion sensing units are triggered, you can immediately make the clever lights turn on to frighten potential robbers.</p>

If  cops are contacted for an incorrect alarm, property owners may need to pay a fine for dispatching cops needlessly. A self-monitored home limits the potential for subsequent charges and incorrect alarms.</p>
