<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.
