The typical factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying an opportunity for the harmful attacker to record these codes and use various breaking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can release a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key captured during the network recovery.</p>
