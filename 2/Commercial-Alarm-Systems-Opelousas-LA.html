<h3>Home Surveillance Security System Opelousas LA 70570</h3>
<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of totally free storage, and use 2 AA batteries that can last approximately two years. Nevertheless, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink doesn't offer you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.

Be prepared to invest more money if extended video storage is very important.</p>
