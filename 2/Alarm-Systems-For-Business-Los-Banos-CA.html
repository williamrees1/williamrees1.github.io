<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
