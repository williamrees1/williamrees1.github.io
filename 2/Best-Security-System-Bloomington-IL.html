<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and fraud. Suggestion: Frequently keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset.

Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating expensive incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it immediately shut off the heating unit. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can automatically make the smart lights turn on to frighten potential intruders.</p>
