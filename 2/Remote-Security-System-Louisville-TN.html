<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
