When the Floodlight camera discovers movement, it turns on its 2 powerful LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Cam also has a loud speaker, so you can talk to whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their actions. Outdoor cameras are among the best ways to hinder (and catch) robbers, vandals, and other wrongdoers.
