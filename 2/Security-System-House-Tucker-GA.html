When a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, email, web, or text portal.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
