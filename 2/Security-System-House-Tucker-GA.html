We create HD CCTV systems for brand name new purchases. A1 Security Cameras has a group of expert specialists here with years of hands on experience. When we suggest "hands on experience", we mean climbing the ladder, running cables, testing security cameras of all sorts and the entire 9 yards that you will need to do to install security camera systems.

<p>Basically, wireless security systems rely on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work utilizing radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to receive sensing units needed to control your equipment including allowing, disabling and sending you instantaneous notifies. When a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, email, web, or text portal. They'll also receive an alert to immediately assist you with emergency responders as needed if your wireless home security system is professionally monitored.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
