<p>Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, Link, and Brinks all use clever locks, video doorbells, thermostats, and other home automation gadgets that you can manage from your mobile phone. Other brands, like Ring and Nest Secure, provide a handful of cool wise gadgets. And some brands don't sell wise equipment of their own but do integrate with typical clever home systems. Here's a look at Vivint security cameras for indoor and outdoor surveillance. Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These people are $18 a month less expensive and been in business 3 decades so I'm comfortable giving them a try.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
