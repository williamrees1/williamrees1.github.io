We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were typically missing, regardless of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home devices like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and inspect that you locked your doors.
