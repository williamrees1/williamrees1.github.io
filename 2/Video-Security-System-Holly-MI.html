In many cases, Geographic Details Systems technology is utilized to exactly assess crime patterns for camera placement; however, the positioning of cameras can also be the result of input from law enforcement officer and other criminal justice stakeholders (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>

A great deal of clever cameras can be configured to do things like this, but few make things as easy as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives simpler and Hive's ecosystem lives up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
