Considered that the positioning of these cameras is really crucial, the criminal activity patterns in areas of interest are typically studied for periods of time to determine crime hotspots where cameras could potentially be placed. In many cases, Geographic Details Systems technology is utilized to exactly assess crime patterns for camera placement; however, the positioning of cameras can also be the result of input from law enforcement officer and other criminal justice stakeholders (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>

A great deal of clever cameras can be configured to do things like this, but few make things as easy as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives simpler and Hive's ecosystem lives up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
