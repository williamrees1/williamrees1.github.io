<p>Basically, wireless security systems depend on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work using radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to receive sensors required to control your equipment consisting of making it possible for, disabling and sending you immediate alerts. When a signal is gotten, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, text, email, or web website.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
