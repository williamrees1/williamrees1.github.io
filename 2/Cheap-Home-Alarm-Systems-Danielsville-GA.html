<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a great security camera and a phenomenal value. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership prepare for extra cloud storage. However the company does offer a Total Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is spotted. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
