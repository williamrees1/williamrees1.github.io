High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT offer just expert installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list provide you a DIY choice. ADT does not have the strongest customer support reputation amongst the companies we thought about, acquiring more than 3,000 complaints on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked most of this as much as the fact that ADT has several million more clients than its rivals, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
