The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more available for a regular monthly cost ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop.

The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any customer in the network that knows the secrets can read all the traffic.</p>

For example, you can have a wise plug turn on a light indoors or activate an external siren when the camera discovers motion.</p>
