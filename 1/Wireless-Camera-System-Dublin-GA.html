<p>Good photo and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand out excessive. Pretty easy to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from far from the house. The 2nd crucial thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly ear-piercing inbuilt alarm, so it works as a home alarm system along with a security camera. That separates it from the items I've currently written, and helps in part to describe its rate.</p>
