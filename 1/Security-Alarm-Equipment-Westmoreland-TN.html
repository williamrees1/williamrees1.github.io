<p>Consider it by doing this, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more sophisticated camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars? It simply does not build up. To use such low prices, makers should cut corners, and completion result is jeopardized performance.
