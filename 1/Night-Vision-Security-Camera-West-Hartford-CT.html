The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our testing. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And despite having an appealing cost and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
<p>In terms of its feature list, it's an outstanding package - there's a heat sensing unit in addition to a camera, which cuts down the number of incorrect positives you're going to get, plus two-way audio and night vision.
