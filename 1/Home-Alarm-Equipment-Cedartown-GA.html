<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a short description of how thermal cameras work: All objects emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy discharged by an item is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it emits. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of detecting small distinctions in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and creates an electronic image based on information about the temperature level distinctions.

This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.
