<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
