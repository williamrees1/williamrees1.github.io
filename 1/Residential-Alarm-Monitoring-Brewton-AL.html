<p>so say you have a camera that somebody can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I recommend to have actually cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras provide an obvious sign for anybody who goes by that they are being taped on CCTV and this can be an excellent deterrent of theft and criminal activity.
