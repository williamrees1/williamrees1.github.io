Essentially, just single-point, tabletop cameras packed with extra motion detectors and sensing units for things like temperature level and ambient light, these devices can be a good suitable for something like a studio apartment that doesn't have a garage door or lots of street windows to protect.</p>
<p>Geofencing: This feature automates motion detection when you return or leave to a predetermined area (normally your home). This way, you don't have to remember to turn off the camera's monitoring functions whenever you get back.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader area and therefore offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
