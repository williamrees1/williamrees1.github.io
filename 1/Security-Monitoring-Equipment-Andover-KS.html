The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with information after the fact, which suggests that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of recording storage space.

<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize a violation. Once a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
