This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

In this post, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The exact same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much photo details as 1080p.
