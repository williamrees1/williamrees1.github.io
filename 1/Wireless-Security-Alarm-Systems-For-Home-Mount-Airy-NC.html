<p>I apologize to all the Wink fans out there, but to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch. Lookout is actually just an excellent name for a kit that consists of a Wink smart home hub and a few security oriented sensing units. You can't equip and deactivate the system. Rather, you turn alerts on and off. As you can't deactivate it, it can't do things that a typical self-monitored system can do like activate a camera to record or activate the siren.
