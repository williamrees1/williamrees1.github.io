<p>Honeywell's Do It Yourself security system depends on a gadget called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top. It acts as the brains of the system, getting in touch with sensors and 3rd party-devices by means of Z-Wave and controlling them using the app or voice control. Another area where Arlo stands out is customer service.
