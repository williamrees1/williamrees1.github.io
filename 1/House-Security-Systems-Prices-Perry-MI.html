Wireless systems are generally more user-friendly, and they can provide a more rewarding experience overall.

If you have old hardwired devices, you can user interface them with a wireless panel by adding a wired to wireless converter, such as the Honeywell 5800C2W.</p>

<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a must for usage when you're away from home, but you should not have to fumble with your phone when you're coming and going.
