The equipment's all provided by third parties, so what you get might be from a different producer than the equipment your neighbor got. Why's that? ADT uses an independent supplier model involving third-party dealers. The dealers determine which equipment to use. Costs for systems differ. Larger systems that use full-house protection with professional monitoring are the most expensive choices. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most inexpensive choice.</p>
