<p>A lot of home security cameras perform the very same basic functions-- they identify an occasion, record the occasion, and send you an alert-- however they do not all perform them the same method. And some cameras have special features that go beyond those essentials. Here are some typical functions you'll experience while shopping and why they are essential (we have actually noted them in alphabetical order). In each of the reviews that follow this purchasers' guide, we'll talk about how each camera delivers on these features.</p>

<p>On the surface, these two camera categories might appear similar, though if you were able to see within, the differences end up being unique and obvious. Commercial-grade cameras are created and developed for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Typically, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is lots of readily available light, and once the lighting becomes low or absent (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to reveal. Since they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality components that can adapt and catch excellent low light video, commercial cameras surpass their more affordable cousins.</p>
