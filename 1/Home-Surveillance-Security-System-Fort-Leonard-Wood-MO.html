<p>Numerous displays were set up within the new command center with a single monitor assigned to alarm screens. As soon as any alarm integrated into the PCU was activated, the nearby camera to that location would be displayed on that particular monitor. The chance that the repaired camera would be pointed in the direction of the event depends on the initial requirements for location of coverage.

Just another sneaky technique to keep extremely lucrative accounts.</p>
