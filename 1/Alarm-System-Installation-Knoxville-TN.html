<p>Home security systems and modern-day smart home capabilities and compatibilities permit you to tap into their sensors and cameras straight from your phone. Try to find a design that provides a high resolution (1080p), a wide angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range up to 25 feet, and inexpensive cloud storage for tape-recorded video.
