The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
