<h3>Alarm Security System For Home in Franklin GA</h3>
<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control panel (usually located in the entrance hall) that is used to disarm the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have actually been set off, smart alarms are managed from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've already left home, and notifies you if any of the sensors have been activated, instead of getting home to find your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly irritating your neighbours).
