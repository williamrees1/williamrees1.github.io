Once we got a sufficient look at those friendly faces, we slanted the entire collection outside for another two weeks to see what sort of results we would get when the cameras faced the house across the street, which is around 50 feet away.</p>

<h3>Alarm House System Groton MA 01450</h3>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
