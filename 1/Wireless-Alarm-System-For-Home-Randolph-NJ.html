<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security bundle, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize police reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a ineffective and pricey method to theft reduction throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
