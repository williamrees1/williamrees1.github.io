<p>All About Security provides professional, reputable alarm monitoring services for homes and organisations throughout the greater Indianapolis area. Over 97% of home security alarms in Seattle end up being false. That's why the Seattle Cops Department (SPD) presented its False Alarm Program in 2004. It utilizes charges and alarm registration to reduce the variety of incorrect alarms to which the department needs to react.

<p>The NVR removes these problems, since it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR.
