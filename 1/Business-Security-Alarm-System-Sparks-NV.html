<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
