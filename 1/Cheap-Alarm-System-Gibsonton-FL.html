<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you mean to save and the length of time you plan to keep taped video footage. The video footage is going to eat up storage area quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
