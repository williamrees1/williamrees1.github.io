<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
