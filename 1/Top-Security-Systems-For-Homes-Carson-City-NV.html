<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the specific very same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
