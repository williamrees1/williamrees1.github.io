We've found lots here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, however you'll find more than 30 brands available. In some cases you don't have an option. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT offer just expert installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list provide you a Do It Yourself option. ADT doesn't have the greatest client service reputation amongst the companies we considered, racking up more than 3,000 problems on its Bbb page While we chalked most of this up to the fact that ADT has several million more clients than its rivals, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>

This also depends upon the provider, however you can expect signing a contract with providers who require expert installation of their systems. The average length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the higher end, some contracts could cover approximately 60 months or 5 years. We would recommend thinking about a Do It Yourself home security system instead if you want to avoid having to sign an agreement.</p>
