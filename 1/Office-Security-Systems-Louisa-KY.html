<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we tested, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you walk by.
