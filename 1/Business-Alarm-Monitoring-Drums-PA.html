<p>So, while alarm may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious.

Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
