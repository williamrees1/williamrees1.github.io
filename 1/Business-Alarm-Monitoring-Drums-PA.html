<p>So, while alarm may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police capability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support cops reaction to alarmed properties) a expensive and inefficient  technique to break-in reduction throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>

Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
