The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our testing.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
