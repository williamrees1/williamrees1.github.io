<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction.

Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
