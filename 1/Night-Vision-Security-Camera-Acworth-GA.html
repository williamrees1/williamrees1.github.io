<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
