<p>The majority of the cameras we checked need an Air Conditioner outlet, so positioning is certainly an aspect. A few models utilize batteries, making placement more versatile, but this requires other compromises, which we highlight in the Competition area. Wi-Fi protection also affects where you position a camera: If you want to put a camera in an area that doesn't get a good Wi-Fi signal, consider upgrading your router or including an extender or repeater. (For a look at our networking choices, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for The Majority Of People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your smartphone or laptop gets good Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to install the camera, you likely won't have a problem.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
