<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to authorities ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers support authorities action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and ineffective  method to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
