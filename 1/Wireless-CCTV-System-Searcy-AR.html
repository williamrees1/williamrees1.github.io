<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
