You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people might find out to be mindful about the periodicals and books they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts."
