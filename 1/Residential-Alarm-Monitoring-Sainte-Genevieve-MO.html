<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
