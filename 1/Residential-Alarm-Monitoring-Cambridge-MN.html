We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With basic clever home devices like automated door locks, you can stay in bed and examine that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you watch out for prospective package thieves or talk to visitors who stop by.</p>
