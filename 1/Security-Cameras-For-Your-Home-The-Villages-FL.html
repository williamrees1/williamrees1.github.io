<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be considered. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a terrific choice for long variety circumstances where trees and poles are not present.</p>
<p>This absolutely depends upon your house. If you have 15 doors and a million windows, then you'll require more sensing units and equipment than someone who lives in a studio apartment. ADT's higher-tier plans do cost more than the majority of other alarm companies-- plus they require a $99 installation fee-- but if you require a great deal of control over the comings and goings of your business, it's probably worth it.

<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically via 110VAC power.</p>
