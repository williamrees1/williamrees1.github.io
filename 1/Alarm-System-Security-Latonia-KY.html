But since a lot of retail theft would not trip an alarm anyhow (an employee slipping some extra cash while giving a client change, for instance), we believe it's more vital to have high-quality images so you have the evidence you need. Which's what Nest gives you.</p>
<p>In its truest form, a CCTV camera is an analog camera that sends signals through coaxial cable to a single main place for video, recording, and monitoring analysis.

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics because this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest culprit for brief battery life by far.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
