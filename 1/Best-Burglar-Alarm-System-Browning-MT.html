<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the concern. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, we believe this issue is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe clients who own the existing system.</p>
