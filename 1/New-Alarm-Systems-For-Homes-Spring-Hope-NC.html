<h3>Security Cameras For Home Spring Hope NC 27882</h3>
<p>There are 2 main types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web protocol (IP) cameras and the standard analog cameras.

<p>Another essential topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough.

Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
