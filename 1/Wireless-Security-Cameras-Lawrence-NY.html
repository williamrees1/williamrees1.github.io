<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
