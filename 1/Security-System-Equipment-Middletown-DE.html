<p>Our alarm systems might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge a violation. When a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
