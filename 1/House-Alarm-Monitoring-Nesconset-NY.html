Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops action to alarmed homes) a pricey and ineffective  method to robbery reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
