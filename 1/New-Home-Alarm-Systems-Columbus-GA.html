<p>3 big benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, expandability and portability. Occupants, unlike homeowners, generally prevent making irreversible modifications to their homes.

Wireless control panels, sensing units and other elements can easily be established at different residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also allow remote control of the system and general home automation.
