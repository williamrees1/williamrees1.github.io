<p>TP-Link's Kasa Webcam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that could equal some of our top picks. It likewise comes with 2 days of free cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can cram in clips of as much as 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control panel and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.

The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly obvious.
