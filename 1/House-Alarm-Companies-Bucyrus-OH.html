Simply a couple years back, the home security market was controlled by a few big names using costly, stiff plans with little versatility and unfriendly, long-lasting contracts. Systems were restricted to a couple wired motion sensing units linked to a keypad control board and go through a landline. Nowadays, this has all altered.</p>

However if you might update to a new office with various security requirements, contract-free is your best choice.</p>

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides free perks like person detection, familiar-face alerts, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 per month.)
