I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter notifies, for instance. Nevertheless, those functions come at a comparatively high rate: $5 each month ($50 per year) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 per year) for one month of video history.  For each extra camera, the membership is marked down to about half of the preliminary charge. By contrast, Arlo charges $3 per month for person detection with 1 month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those bumps and functions storage approximately 31 days.</p>

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>As pointed out in the past, plans include the Requirement ($30.99 a month, expert monitoring, fire and intrusion alarms, two-way voice to monitoring stations), Gold ($35.99 a month, whatever that comes with Standard in addition to home automation features like lights, locks, and a push-button control app), and Elite ($40.99, all of the Gold features with included HD video monitoring) plans.
