For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hours a day using IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would need 2.79 terabytes of storage space for footage, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

If there are three select fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single fixed camera can just view one.
