<p>In location of the landline connection which standard home security systems need, wireless security systems interact through radio frequency and use a built-in cellular connection. TP-Link is understood for its solid, no-nonsense, no-frills home security package, and the manufacturer is constantly worth a look if you want some trustworthy hardware at an affordable price. That's certainly true of the Kasa Area KC100, a home security camera designed for the indoors.</p>
<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most cost-effective monitoring plan starting at $10.

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your clever outlets with your general security system. With the advances in technology, monitoring a home security system is relatively simple.
