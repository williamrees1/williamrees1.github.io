As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed government agents tends to deter things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "people may learn to be careful about the periodicals and books they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers.
