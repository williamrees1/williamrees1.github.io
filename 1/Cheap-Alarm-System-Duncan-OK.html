<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
