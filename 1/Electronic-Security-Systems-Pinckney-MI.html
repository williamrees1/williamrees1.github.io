Central station operators might be advised to call emergency services immediately, or to first call the secured properties or residential or commercial property supervisor to attempt to figure out if the alarm is real. Operators might also start calling a list of phone numbers provided by the client to call somebody to go check on the secured premises. Some zones might set off a call to the local heating oil company to go look at the system, or a call to the owner with information of which room might be getting flooded.
