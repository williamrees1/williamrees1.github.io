<p>Analog hd cameras are a terrific option for companies to upgrade from analog CCTV that has actually already been wired utilizing coax cable television or CAT-5 cable television. AHD cameras use the very same RG59 or RG6 cable as standard CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable television with video baluns can also be used. While pro monitoring expenses more, it's more secure.
