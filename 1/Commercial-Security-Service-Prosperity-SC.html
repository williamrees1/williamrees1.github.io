Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you stroll by.
