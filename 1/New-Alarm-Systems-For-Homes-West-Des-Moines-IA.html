<p>Blink cameras are compact, include totally free storage, and use 2 AA batteries that can last approximately 2 years. However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink doesn't give you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.
