<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
