<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.

If you dispatch a guard, you only have to pay. Prices differ. Among the obstacles clever alarm systems position to the consumer is the risk of being hacked.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides free perks like individual detection, familiar-face informs, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 monthly.) However, in our tests the familiar-face signals worked just about 50 percent of the time and the camera routinely detached from the network several times a day (when everything else on our network seemed fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, as well as when we made changes in the settings.</p>
