ADT doesn't have that alternative. You need to talk to an agent and get a quote. Then, throughout installation, the service person may also make recommendations.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
