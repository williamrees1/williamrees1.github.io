<p>Power-over-Ethernet switches apply just to NVR systems, but they cut out other parts that would be necessary for a DVR system, like extra source of power and the BNC cables utilized to connect cameras to the DVR. Instead, when you connect a PoE switch to your network, you've got a source of power and a way of transferring information to your NVR all in one bundle. When picking which type of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system, the biggest factor to consider.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>

<p>Take notice of the existing lighting in the areas where you wish to install security cameras. Look for the night vision range of each camera and consider just how much location you wish to cover.
