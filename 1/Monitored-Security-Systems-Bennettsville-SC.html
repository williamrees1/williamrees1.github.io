<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and absolutely love it. Terrific clearness. I wished to establish viewing on my cellular phone but had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter alerts, for instance.

<h3>Outdoor Security Systems Bennettsville SC 29512</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats since this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capability is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>Since the glass real estate does not get in the way, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they make up for it in abilities. In addition to being excellent for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for low-light and infrared given that the glass real estate doesn't hamper the lens. With some, it's hard to inform at a glimpse where they've been intended, so they can offer a panoptic impression as a deterrent, regardless of their real field of view. Installing a video surveillance system with a few of these is an excellent option for a number of various configurations.</p>
